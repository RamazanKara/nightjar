/**
 * Shows each decoded frame at the host's frame time plus a small delay that covers recent jitter
 * (protocol/core/src/present_clock.rs), so the screen keeps the game's frame times instead of the
 * network's. With adaptive refresh, the display refreshes at those times.
 *
 * MediaCodec carries its own input timestamps, so the host timestamp of each queued frame is kept
 * here until the decoder hands the frame back.
 *
 * The clock also runs, without scheduling anything, when only the clock sync is wanted: with
 * host frame times off, a host that announced clock sync is still probed so the timing CSV can
 * carry the clock offset. Then [presentNs] returns the ready time unchanged.
 *
 * On a panel with a fixed refresh rate, [presentOnGrid] moves the same schedule onto the
 * display's vsync grid: it names the vsync a frame is meant for and when to release it so the
 * compositor takes it for that vsync. [contentRateMilliHz] is the rate the game presents at,
 * from the host timestamps of the frames passed to [onQueued].
