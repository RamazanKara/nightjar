/**
 * Deadline present scheduling for a display with a fixed refresh rate, on top of
 * [HostFrameClock]: where a decoded frame goes on the panel's vsync grid, and whether it is so
 * late that a newer decoded frame should replace it.
 *
 * A frame is meant for the first vsync it can make, which is what releasing it at once would
 * give, unless the game's cadence puts it later. The most it is moved past that vsync is one
 * (the clock's rule); this class only turns the display's timing into the clock's arguments:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Android shows a buffer queued at least the presentation deadline before a vsync at that
 *   vsync, so a frame ready at t is ready for the grid at t + deadline.</li>
 *   <li>The buffer's timestamp is the time it is due; the compositor takes it at the first vsync
 *   at or after it. A quarter of a vsync before the vsync keeps it after the vsync before, so a
 *   frame planned a vsync later is not shown a vsync early.</li>
 *   <li>The target is rounded to the nearest vsync (a slack of half a vsync), not up: the extra
 *   half vsync a frame waited on average was the largest part of what the schedule added. A frame
 *   still never goes before the first vsync it can make.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Late frames. The clock holds each frame to the host time plus a delay that covers recent
 * jitter: on the grid the 75th percentile of the lateness window. A frame is behind the game's
 * cadence when it is ready more than half a content interval after the 97th percentile of the
 * window (PERCENTILE here), not after the clock's delay; the caller drops it when a newer output is already decoded, never two in a row. The
 * lateness window is kept here, not read from the clock, because the clock must see a frame only
 * once and a dropped frame must not take a vsync from the frame that replaces it.
