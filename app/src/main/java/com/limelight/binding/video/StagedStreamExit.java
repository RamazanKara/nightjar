/**
 * Experimental: the order a stream ends in on an Android TV that is showing HDR.
 *
 * <p>Some TVs (NVIDIA Shield on an HDR screen) lose the HDMI signal when the HDR to SDR switch and
 * the display mode revert overlap. So the exit is staged: stop the connection and release the
 * video output (HDR turns off), wait until the display stops reporting changes, give the display
 * mode back ourselves, wait again, and only then finish the activity. Every wait is capped.
 *
 * <p>This class only decides; the activity does the work and calls {@link #poll} on its UI
 * thread every {@link #POLL_MS}. Not thread safe. Phones, tablets and SDR streams never use it.
