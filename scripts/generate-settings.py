ADVICE = {
    "checkbox_always_dark": "Choose System to follow the system theme, Dark for the dark grey theme on app screens, menus and dialogs even when the system uses a light theme (as most TVs do), or OLED black for pure black backgrounds. Applies immediately and stays separate from stream profiles. Stored as two switches, `checkbox_always_dark` and `checkbox_oled_black`; OLED black sets both, System clears both. High contrast keeps the app black whatever is chosen here.",
    "list_ui_scale": "Raise for large, readable menus on a TV or a small phone; lower to fit more on screen. Scales the whole app layout, not the stream, and the system font size still applies on top. Applies immediately and stays separate from stream profiles.",
    "list_ui_mode": "Automatic follows the device. Choose TV on a handheld or phone that is connected to a TV (a Retroid Pocket docked over HDMI, for example) to get the TV layouts with focus, a remote or gamepad and larger rows; choose Handheld to get the touch layouts on a TV. The stream is not changed. Applies immediately and stays separate from stream profiles.",
    "checkbox_high_contrast": "Enable for a black background, body-coloured secondary text and outlines (7:1 against the background) and a 4 dp focus ring on every app screen. The stream is unchanged. Applies immediately and stays separate from stream profiles.",
    "list_reduce_motion": "Follow system reduces motion when Android's animation scale is 0 or animators are off. Reduce always swaps the focus zoom and sheet slide for a plain ring; Full always animates. Applies immediately and stays separate from stream profiles.",
    "list_resolution": "Choose Custom to enter a fixed width and height (64–16384 pixels each) for every stream without a resolution override. Named profiles, PC and game overrides retain their priority. Custom dimensions stay fixed when the screen changes. Raise for detail; lower for less network and decoding load. The picker also includes screen and standard sizes; larger fixed presets stay listed while chosen. Changing resolution preserves an explicitly chosen bitrate.",
    "list_fps": "Raise for smoother motion on a fast screen. Open the list and choose Show all frame rates to include rates the screen may not support (possible stutter; compare rendered FPS in the overlay), or Show supported frame rates only to go back. Stored as `checkbox_unlock_fps`. The screen's own refresh rate is added as Screen refresh rate. Changing resolution or FPS preserves an explicitly chosen bitrate.",
    "stream_profiles": "Open to create, rename, duplicate or delete named profiles (sets of stream values such as Home 4K120 or Hotel), pick the profile in use, and optionally let the network pick one when a stream starts. A profile sets only the values chosen in it. See [named profiles](#named-profiles-and-game-settings).",
    "list_mobile_bitrate_kbps": "Choose a cap for streams that start on mobile data or on Wi-Fi that Android marks as metered, such as a phone's hotspot. It caps the bitrate from every layer, including profiles, PC and game values; Off uses the same bitrate on every network. Read once at stream start. See [named profiles](#named-profiles-and-game-settings).",
    "checkbox_auto_bitrate": "Off by default. Lowers the bitrate when the connection, decoder or device heat can't keep up and raises it again when things recover, never above Video bitrate and never below a built-in floor (2 Mbps, or more for large streams). The host's own adjustment stands down while it runs. This is the default for every PC; the stream menu's Automatic bitrate saves a choice for one PC, and changing this switch makes every PC follow it again. Needs a host that supports runtime bitrate changes (currently Rubylight).",
    "checkbox_vulkan_render": "Presents H.264, HEVC and AV1 through Vulkan with its own frame pacing, for frame-generation overlays that hook Vulkan. It adds a render pass, so some latency, and needs Android 10 and a GPU with Vulkan 1.1. If it cannot be used (PyroWave, Android 9 or older, no Vulkan support, 4:4:4 video, or it fails to start) the stream uses direct output and a message says why. While it is on, client-side upscaling is off. If it stops working during a stream, the stream ends with a message that names it; turn this switch off to go back. Leave it off unless you need such an overlay.",
    "seekbar_bitrate_kbps": "Raise for image quality on a stable link; lower for network loss. The slider is logarithmic; the buttons make fine adjustments.",
    "checkbox_rate_change_bitrate": "Off by default, under Advanced: turn on to let this device lower or raise the bitrate from its own frame loss and network delay readings, in place of Device controls bitrate. Needs the Rust engine and a host that offers bitrate changes; other streams use Device controls bitrate.",
    "video_format": "Start with Automatic. Choose a specific codec to compare decoder performance; Prefer AV1 and Prefer HEVC fall back when the PC or device lacks them. PyroWave requires a host that supports it (Rubylight, or Vibepollo with PyroWave available) and Vulkan capabilities; on a PC whose host has none, that PC uses the setting for all PCs or Automatic instead.",
    "adaptive_quality_mode": "Off by default. Motion preserves FPS first, Detail preserves resolution first, and Battery also reduces work on healthy links. Lowers resolution or frame rate when the network, slow decoding or heat keep the stream from running well; not available with PyroWave. The stream menu can override the mode per PC.",
    "adaptive_quality_min_resolution": "Sets the smallest short edge for automatic quality, with the aspect ratio preserved. The selected starting resolution is the ceiling; a minimum above that ceiling is clamped down. Shown while Lower resolution or frame rate when needed is not Off.",
    "adaptive_quality_min_fps": "Sets the lowest FPS automatic quality may request, including Battery mode. Recovery increases one step after 30 healthy seconds; reductions are at least 15 seconds apart. Shown while Lower resolution or frame rate when needed is not Off.",
    "upscaling_mode": "Choose a stream resolution below the screen size for SDR upscaling. Smooth is bilinear; Sharp (FSR) and Sharp, Snapdragon (SGSR) add edge sharpening. PyroWave uses SGSR for both FSR and SGSR selections. HDR and 10-bit streams use direct output; the row says so.",
    "upscaling_sharpness": "Reduce for halos or ringing; raise for soft edges. Applies on the next stream. At 0%, FSR skips extra sharpening; SGSR still reconstructs edges. Shown only with Sharp (FSR) or Sharp, Snapdragon (SGSR).",
    "checkbox_enable_hdr": "Enable with an HDR10 screen, a compatible decoder and HDR configured on the host display. Availability is device-filtered.",
    "checkbox_enable_sdr_10bit": "Enable if you see banding in gradients and the screen has no HDR, or HDR is off. Streams SDR in 10-bit HEVC or AV1 and needs a Main10 decoder on this device and a PC that offers 10-bit; otherwise the stream is 8-bit and the app says so. The PC's display must be in SDR: with HDR on it, the stream is HDR. Not used with PyroWave. Takes effect on the next stream.",
    "checkbox_vrr": "Enable Android's automatic ARR policy on supported Android 16 displays; otherwise request maximum refresh. Hosts that support VRR are asked for it too. Overrides pacing to Lowest latency and disables the lower refresh rate.",
    "checkbox_host_frame_times": "Enable for even motion when the network or decoder adds jitter, especially with Adaptive refresh on a screen with ARR. Each MediaCodec frame is released at its host timestamp plus a delay covering about 97% of recent frames; later frames are shown at once. Adds that delay (usually a few milliseconds) and replaces Frame pacing. Hosts that announce clock sync (Rubylight) add the host-to-present latency to the performance overlay. PyroWave streams are not affected.",
    "checkbox_content_rate_frame_rate": "Enable on a screen with several refresh modes, with Allow lower refresh rate (or a Balanced with FPS limit or Smoothest video pacing) on. Once the game's frame rate has held steady for two seconds, Android is told that rate and may move the screen to a mode that divides it evenly, for example 60 Hz for a 60 fps game in a 120 fps stream. Only seamless changes are requested (Android 11 or newer), at most one every two seconds, and never below the rate Allow lower refresh rate off keeps. Needs a host that announces clock sync (Rubylight); has no effect with Adaptive refresh, a TextureView or PyroWave.",
    "checkbox_virtual_display": "Enable to request a host display matching the stream. Requires host support and a ready display driver.",
    "host_display_location": "Explains where the mode is set: open the PC's menu, choose a mode and confirm Save display mode. Keep PC display primary preserves the monitor's primary role; make virtual display primary moves it to the stream. Saved separately per PC.",
    "seekbar_virtual_display_scale": "Change the PC's render resolution relative to the stream. Desktop text size stays as set on the host.",
    "list_virtual_display_dpi": "Raise for larger text and interface on the virtual display, for example on a small screen; the resolution does not change. PC's own keeps the scale set on the PC. Rubylight PCs read it; other hosts ignore it.",
    "checkbox_yuv444": "Enable for colored text and desktop detail when both ends support it. Otherwise 4:2:0 is used; HDR takes priority.",
    "checkbox_stretch_video": "How the stream fills a screen of another shape: Fit shows all of it with bars, Fill (crop) fills the screen and cuts off the edges that do not fit, Stretch fills it and distorts shapes, 1:1 pixels shows the stream at its own size, centred. The key is the older Stretch switch, still written (on only for Stretch) so older versions behave sensibly; the mode itself is stored as `video_scaling`. Also in the stream menu. See [video scaling](video-and-latency.md#video-scaling).",
    "video_alignment": "Top places a Fit or 1:1 picture at the top of the screen, leaving the space below for the soft keyboard or the lower half of a half-folded phone. No effect on Fill and Stretch, which cover the whole screen.",
    "stream_orientation": "Automatic keeps the earlier behaviour: phones in landscape; tablets, squarish screens, windows and external displays in any orientation. Landscape and Portrait lock the screen; Rotate with device follows it within the system rotation lock. A host streaming from its virtual display starts the stream in the screen's shape, and with Rotate with device asks for the turned size while the stream runs where the host takes in-stream reconfigure. Other hosts keep the stream's size and Video scaling fits it into the turned screen. Hidden on TVs. See [orientation](video-and-latency.md#orientation).",
    "seekbar_deadzone": "Raise to suppress stick drift; lower for small movements. Games can add their own deadzone on top.",
    "checkbox_multi_controller": "Leave on so each controller is its own player and the PC sees controllers as they connect. Turn off to make every controller player 1 and keep one controller present on the PC, for games that need one before any connects.",
    "controller_button_mapping": "Open Controller buttons, press a digital button and choose its output or Nothing. Mappings default to the original button, are saved per controller model and apply next stream.",
    "controller_test": "Open Controller test to see buttons, sticks, triggers and the D-pad live and to try rumble, lights, motion sensors and the touchpad where the controller has them. Works with a D-pad or controller alone; hold B or Back for one second to leave. Leaving stops rumble and restores the lights. See [controller test](controls.md#controller-test).",
    "checkbox_flip_face_buttons": "Enable to swap A/B and X/Y on physical and on-screen gamepads.",
    "checkbox_gamepad_motion_sensors": "Enable for controller gyro/accelerometer input on Android 12+. Fresh Android 12 (API 31) installations override this to Off because of an OS sensor bug.",
    "checkbox_gamepad_motion_fallback": "Enable to use this device's motion sensors when a controller lacks them. Player 1 also switches to them when the controller's gyroscope reports only zeros for a second. Hidden if the device has neither gyro nor accelerometer.",
    "checkbox_vibrate_fallback": "Enable to feel host rumble on this device when the controller has no rumble motors.",
    "seekbar_vibrate_fallback_strength": "Adjust device rumble strength; 100% is normal strength.",
    "checkbox_gamepad_touchpad_as_mouse": "Enable to always move the host pointer with the controller touchpad instead of forwarding native touchpad input.",
    "checkbox_disable_rumble": "Enable to stop every vibration the host asks for: controller and trigger rumble, USB DualSense waveform haptics and Vibrate device for rumble. Checked once at stream start.",
    "checkbox_mouse_emulation": "Leave on to toggle controller mouse mode by holding Start.",
    "analog_scrolling": "Choose which stick scrolls in controller mouse mode. The other moves the pointer; with None, both move it.",
    "checkbox_mouse_emulation_fixed_step": "Enable for precise pointing in controller mouse mode: hold X while moving the stick to move a fixed step; Y doubles the step from 1 to 128 pixels, then wraps to 1.",
    "checkbox_touchscreen_trackpad": "Use Trackpad for relative cursor movement, Direct mouse to point at a screen location, Multi-touch for host touch input, Local cursor for a pointer drawn on this device with no round trip, or Touch off to ignore fingers while playing with a controller (Back still opens the stream menu). Unsupported native touch falls back to Direct mouse. The picker's Help explains each mode. See [touch modes](controls.md#touch-modes).",
    "seekbar_trackpad_speed": "Adjust Trackpad movement; 100% is normal speed.",
    "seekbar_local_cursor_speed": "Adjust Local cursor movement; at 100% the drawn pointer moves as far as your finger.",
    "checkbox_trackpad_acceleration": "Enable so slow finger movement aims precisely and fast swipes cover more distance. Trackpad and Local cursor; applies from the next stream.",
    "list_trackpad_acceleration_curve": "Choose how strongly fast swipes are sped up.",
    "checkbox_trackpad_momentum": "Enable so the pointer keeps gliding after a quick flick. A new touch, a mode change, the stream menu, picture-in-picture and disconnecting stop it at once. Trackpad and Local cursor.",
    "list_trackpad_momentum_glide": "Choose how far the pointer glides.",
    "list_trackpad_area": "Limit where Trackpad and Local cursor gestures may start, for example to rest a thumb on one side; touches that start elsewhere are ignored.",
    "list_three_finger_tap": "Choose System keyboard (default), PC keyboard, Keyboard & mouse, Middle click or Off. Works in Trackpad, Direct mouse and Local cursor modes.",
    "list_four_finger_tap": "Choose Keyboard & mouse, System keyboard, PC keyboard, Middle click or Off (default). Four fingers never also trigger the three-finger action.",
    "seekbar_mouse_speed": "Adjust physical relative mouse movement; 100% is normal speed.",
    "checkbox_mouse_nav_buttons": "Enable to send mouse Back/Forward buttons. Disable if it interferes with right-click.",
    "checkbox_absolute_mouse_mode": "Enable for desktop pointer acceleration. Leave off for game mouse look. Available on Android 8+ except devices using the separate raw pointer path.",
    "checkbox_input_only_any_host": "Enable to add Input-only to a game's menu on PCs whose host has no Input-only mode of its own (Sunshine, GameStream, Apollo with its input-only mode off). The PC still streams video and audio at 640x360, 30 FPS and 500 kbps, about 0.7 Mbit/s with overhead; Nightjar discards both. Hosts with their own mode keep using their Input-only tile. See [Input-only on any PC](controls.md#input-only-on-any-pc).",
    "keyboard_shortcuts_editor": "Create, edit or delete up to 32 named keyboard chords for the extra keyboard toolbar. Import/export JSON files to transfer them; importing asks before replacing the saved list. See [custom keyboard shortcuts](controls.md#custom-keyboard-shortcuts).",
    "checkbox_back_as_meta": "Enable to send the Windows key from a physical keyboard's Back key. Android's Back gesture and TV remotes keep their local navigation; the controller menu chord remains available. See [keyboard options](controls.md#keyboard-options).",
    "checkbox_back_opens_menu": "Enable for a handheld's dedicated physical Back key, such as on AYN Thor, to open the stream menu instead of being forwarded as a controller button. Off preserves its existing mapping. Select/Start, mouse right-click and Keyboard Back sends Windows key keep their behavior. Applies from the next stream.",
    "checkbox_back_as_guide": "Enable so Back on a handheld's built-in controls sends Guide (Home/PS), for handhelds such as the Retroid Pocket whose system button acts as Back: the built-in pad's Back when it has its own Select, a built-in Back key and a Back the firmware injects. External controllers and pads whose Select or Start is Back keep it. Physical Back opens stream menu takes priority; Android's Back gesture and the controller menu chord still open the stream menu. Android only: desktop controllers report a real Guide button. Applies from the next stream.",
    "checkbox_capture_system_keys": "On by default. Esc, Alt+Tab, the Windows key and similar go to the PC while input is captured, and an external keyboard's Back key (the Esc key of many Android keyboards) sends Esc on Android 10 and newer; a built-in keyboard's Back stays Back. Android hands Alt+Tab and the Windows key to apps only on Android 16 QPR2 and newer (keyboard capture) and on many Samsung devices; elsewhere, and for Home, power and volume, Android keeps them. Keyboard Back sends Windows key and Physical Back opens stream menu take priority for keyboard Back. Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M and Android's Back gesture open the stream menu. Matches desktop's Send system keys. Applies from the next stream.",
    "checkbox_right_alt_as_meta": "Enable on a Mac host so Right Alt acts as Command (the Windows key). Left Alt is unchanged; leave off if you type with AltGr.",
    "checkbox_keyboard_follows_text_fields": "Opens the on-screen keyboard when a text field in the stream gets focus, with the field's type (numbers, no suggestions for passwords), and closes it when the field loses focus. Needs a host that sends text field notices; an attached hardware keyboard keeps typing instead.",
    "checkbox_clipboard_sync": "Off by default. Turn on to share copied text both ways while streaming. Android lets the app read the clipboard only while the stream is in front, so copies made in other apps go when you return. Needs a host that offers clipboard sync and lets this device read and write its clipboard. It carries text only: copy a PC image from the stream menu, and send large copies with Send clipboard to host.",
    "list_pc_keyboard_layout": "Pick the legends of the on-screen PC keyboard. Automatic follows the system language (German or English). Keys send positions, so the PC's Windows layout decides the character: set both alike.",
    "seekbar_pc_keyboard_size": "How much of the screen height the PC keyboard may take, 30-70%. Smaller leaves more of the stream visible; larger gives bigger keys.",
    "seekbar_pc_keyboard_opacity": "How opaque the PC keyboard is, 30-100%. Lower shows more of the stream behind it.",
    "checkbox_show_onscreen_controls": "Enable a touchscreen gamepad. The group is hidden on devices without a touchscreen.",
    "list_osc_style": "Pick Modern for analog sticks that follow your thumb, face buttons you can press two at a time and a layout you edit in place (stream menu → Edit controller layout), kept for all games or for one game. Classic keeps the original controller and its layout. Both send the same gamepad.",
    "list_osc_stick_mode": "Floating centers a stick where your thumb lands, so you need not hit it exactly; pick Fixed if you prefer to aim at the drawn stick. Shown only with Controller style Modern.",
    "seekbar_osc_stick_deadzone": "Raise if a resting thumb drifts the camera or character; lower for finer aim. 8% suits most phones. Shown only with Controller style Modern.",
    "checkbox_vibrate_osc": "Enable feedback when pressing virtual buttons.",

    "seekbar_osc_opacity": "Lower to see more of the game beneath the controls.",
    "reset_osc": "Confirm to restore virtual button sizes and positions, for the classic and the modern controller, including layouts kept for one game. This layout is kept separately from a global settings reset.",
    "checkbox_enable_perf_overlay": "Choose Compact, Statistics or Debug while diagnosing frame rate, network loss or delay; Off hides the overlay. Compact is one line: rendered FPS, network round trip (RTT) and frame loss behind a green, amber or red dot. Statistics summarizes the stream with a status line of lasting facts. Debug shows detailed measured stages and is always available. Stored as `checkbox_enable_perf_overlay` (On for any choice but Off) and `performance_overlay_mode` (compact, statistics or debug; Off keeps the last mode). Can also be changed in the stream menu → Display → Overlay and diagnostics; Copy stats includes Debug details.",
    "gpu_driver": "Import and select a compatible Snapdragon Vulkan driver for PyroWave. Shown on arm64 Adreno devices only. The system driver remains the default; changes apply to the next stream.",

    "checkbox_host_audio": "Enable to hear audio on the PC as well as Android.",
    "checkbox_enable_mic": "Enable to talk in games and chat apps on the PC. Asks for microphone access; if it is not allowed, the setting stays off. The PC hears it as its streaming microphone. Mute it from the stream menu; the overlay shows whether it is sending.",
    "checkbox_mic_button": "Leave on for a round button on the stream that mutes and unmutes with one tap; drag it anywhere and it stays there. Shown only while the PC takes the microphone. Turn off to mute from the stream menu only; the menu's Input section can show or hide it during a stream.",
    "list_mic_echo_cancel": "Leave on Automatic: it cancels echo with the speaker and turns off with headphones or a Bluetooth headset, following a switch during the stream. Pick On if the PC hears its own game sound through a headset.",
    "checkbox_mic_noise_suppression": "Enable to filter fans and other steady noise out of the microphone.",
    "checkbox_mic_auto_gain": "Enable when your voice swings between quiet and loud. Some devices level speech on their own.",
    "seekbar_mic_gain": "Raise if the PC hears you too quietly, lower if it hears you too loudly. Applied before sending; loud peaks are rounded off rather than clipped. 100 % leaves the sound as it is.",
    "checkbox_enable_audiofx": "Enable for Android equalizers or effects. Can add delay and changes the audio output path.",
    "checkbox_audio_passthrough": "Enable for a receiver, soundbar or TV that decodes Dolby Digital or Dolby Digital Plus, or takes multichannel PCM as is. Asks a Rubylight PC for a format the audio output reports it plays, and keeps Opus otherwise. Dolby comes in 32 ms frames, so sound arrives later than Opus. Android 10 and later with the New streaming engine; hidden elsewhere.",
    "checkbox_enable_post_stream_toast": "Enable to see the average decode time after a session ends; it is not end-to-end latency.",
    "checkbox_enable_pip": "Enable to keep a small video window when leaving the app. Input and overlay are hidden there; requires device support.",
    "checkbox_auto_reconnect": "On by default. Resume the same running game after transport failures or returning from screen lock, up to five attempts within one minute. Back or leaving during a retry cancels it. Graceful termination, pairing, permissions and decoder failures stay manual; recovery never launches or replaces a game. Installs that stored the old default (off) were switched on once; turning it off again is kept.",
    "performance_overlay_position": "Choose the corner the performance overlay starts in. It moves to a free corner when on-screen controls would cover it, and always stays inside the camera cutout. Right-hand corners align the text to the right. Can also be changed in the stream menu → Display → Overlay and diagnostics → Position, which takes effect at once.",
    "list_network_grace": "Off by default: the stream ends after 10 seconds without contact, as before. 20, 30 or 60 seconds keeps it open through a Wi-Fi roam, a short dropout or a VPN moving between Wi-Fi and mobile data; the picture freezes until the network returns. Longer waits only help if the host waits too, so raise its own client timeout. When the wait runs out the stream ends with a message saying so, and Recover interrupted streams, if on, then reconnects. See [network drops](video-and-latency.md#network-drops).",
    "checkbox_client_roaming": "On by default. When this device changes networks, the stream moves to the new address instead of waiting for the old one. Only with the Rust engine and a Rubylight PC that offers client roaming; other PCs keep the network grace period.",
    "checkbox_roaming_metered": "Off by default. Lets client roaming move the stream onto mobile data or another metered network. Leave off unless you want streams to keep running on mobile data; streaming uses a lot of data.",

    "checkbox_vendor_low_latency": "Leave on for supported chipset decoder keys. Disable to isolate vendor-specific instability.",
    "list_hevc_low_latency_mode": "Auto by default: every HEVC decoder gets the Android and vendor low-latency flags except Amlogic's, which stall the display with them. On gives them to Amlogic decoders too, with a warning in the log. Off omits them on any device and disables HEVC reference-frame invalidation; turn it on if HEVC video stutters or freezes. H.264, AV1 and decoder performance hints keep their own settings. Off is stored in the older switch's key `checkbox_disable_hevc_low_latency` as true, so older saved values and profiles keep their meaning; this key only tells Auto from On. Applies to the next stream and decoder benchmark; changing it invalidates previous benchmark results.",
    "checkbox_codec_performance": "Leave on for decoder priority/rate hints on Android 6+. Disable to compare heat or battery use.",
    "checkbox_phone_performance_hints": "Enable for a measured comparison on Android 12+; compare decode time with it on and off.",
    "checkbox_experimental_chipset_tuning": "Off by default. Sends `vdec-lowlatency` to MediaTek Dimensity (`c2.mtk`) decoders and, with decoder performance hints on, asks Samsung Exynos decoders for the operating rate they declare next to the realtime priority hint. Needs vendor low-latency options on and HEVC low-latency flags not disabled. Only the first configure try carries them, so a decoder that rejects them falls back to the normal options. If video stops or stutters, turn it off.",
    "checkbox_gpu_max_clocks": "Off by default. Optionally request higher Adreno GPU clocks during PyroWave streaming to reduce decode time; this can increase power use and heat. Thermal protection remains active. Installs that already stored a choice keep it. Shown on Adreno devices only.",

    "checkbox_usb_dualsense": "Enable for direct USB DualSense/Edge input, feedback and adaptive triggers. Accept the explanation and Android USB permission during a stream; Bluetooth retains Android's input path.",
    "checkbox_usb_dualsense_haptics": "Enable alongside the USB DualSense driver for native waveform feedback. Hosts that support it (currently Rubylight) also forward controller speaker, headset and microphone audio. Microphone streaming needs its separate setting and Android permission; the controller mute button follows the stream mute. Reconnect after changing this option. USB only.",
    "checkbox_usb_switch_pro": "Enable to read a wired Nintendo Switch Pro Controller directly: calibrated sticks, Home and Capture, motion, rumble, player lights and battery.
