#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds a release nightjar and packs it as a tar.gz, with the PyroWave SDK the GPU decoder
# loads at run time when one is given (the Linux counterpart of package-windows.ps1):
#
#   package-linux.sh -f <FFmpeg prefix from ffmpeg-decode-only.sh> [-s <PyroWave SDK folder from scripts/build-pyrowave-sdk.sh>]
#                    [-o <folder>] [-t <target dir>] [-v <version>]
#
# Needs the packages from README.md ("Building", Linux). SDL3 is linked statically (see
# Cargo.toml). FFmpeg is the decode-only build in -f (libavcodec, libavutil, libdav1d; the
# distributions' FFmpeg has other sonames than the build machine's, or is not installed, as on
# SteamOS): nightjar is linked against it with the run path $ORIGIN/lib, and the package ships
# the libraries in lib/. libopus and the desktop libraries (X11 or Wayland, audio, udev, libva,
# Vulkan) stay the system's, so the package lists what `ldd` finds for them (and, on Debian and
# Ubuntu, the packages that own them, in LINUX-RUNTIME.txt). -v names the
# package after a release version instead of the crate's (the release workflow passes the
# app version); the archive is nightjar-desktop-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz. The unpacked
# archive is checked: every FFmpeg library nightjar loads must come from the archive.
#
# With -s the package carries libpyrowave-shared.so next to the executable (nothing links it, the
# client loads it by path at run time), its build-info.txt as pyrowave-sdk-build-info.txt and
# its licences. The script refuses a library that is not the one pyrowave-sdk.pin names
# (commit, Granite, API, patches) or whose SHA-256 is not the one the build recorded, before the
# long build. With it the unpacked archive is also run as `nightjar --check-pyrowave` (see the end of
# the script). Without it the package has no GPU decoder and the client says so when asked for it.
