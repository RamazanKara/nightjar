//! The persistent log: everything the process writes to stderr, timestamped, in
//! `<config dir>/logs/nightjar.log` (`logpipe.rs` holds the operating-system part that diverts
//! stderr into a pipe; this module is the file side and has no OS code).
//!
//! - At start `nightjar.log` becomes `nightjar.prev.log` (the older prev is replaced) and a new
//!   `nightjar.log` is created, so the last two runs are kept. If the old file cannot be moved
//!   (a viewer holds the prev file, a second instance runs) the current file is truncated instead
//!   and one line on stderr says so.
//! - A file is capped at [`CAP`]. When a run writes more, the file is rotated the same way and the
//!   run goes on in a fresh `nightjar.log`, so the newest output is always kept and the folder
//!   stays under twice the cap. (That mid-run rotation also replaces the previous run's prev file.)
//!   If that rotation fails the file keeps growing and is tried again after another cap.
//! - Every line gets a UTC wall-clock prefix with milliseconds. The stamp is taken when the
//!   reader thread reads a chunk, not when the line was written, which is within a few
//!   milliseconds. `\r\n` is stored as `\n`; a line that is still open when a chunk ends gets no
//!   second stamp from the next chunk.
//! - Lines are redacted before they reach the file (see [`Redactor`]), so a line is written, and
//!   stamped, when its end arrives. The real stderr gets the bytes unchanged.
//! - Two threads: the reader ([`pump_reader`]) only reads the pipe and forwards to the real
//!   stderr, the writer ([`pump_writer`]) does the file work. A channel joins them and never
//!   blocks the reader: what the writer has not taken yet is held back (up to
//!   [`BACKLOG_BYTES`]). Only above that, on a stalled disk, are lines lost; they are counted and
//!   the log says so at the next line break once the disk recovers. So a slow disk never blocks
//!   `eprintln!` on the stream threads, and a fast one never loses a line.
