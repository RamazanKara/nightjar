//! Diverts the process's stderr into `logfile.rs`.
//!
//! Release builds on Windows have no console, so the `eprintln!("nightjar: ...")` diagnostics (and
//! whatever native libraries write to stderr) would be lost. [`start`] makes a pipe the process's
//! stderr. Two threads serve it:
//!
//! - "log" reads the pipe and passes the bytes unchanged to the real stderr if there is one
//!   (a console gets them as UTF-16), then hands a copy to the writer with `try_send`. It never
//!   waits for the disk.
//! - "log-file" stamps the lines and writes them to the file.
//!
//! Callers keep using `eprintln!`: a write goes into the pipe, as it would have gone to the
//! console, and takes no lock and does no file work on the calling thread.
//!
//! [`shutdown`] puts the real stderr back and waits (up to a second) for both threads to drain
//! what is in the pipe and flush the file. It runs on every exit path: the end of `main`,
//! `process::exit`, and the panic hook (release builds abort on panic).
//!
//! A failure to set this up is printed as one line and the client runs on without the file.
