//! The raced presenter's scheduling (B10 step 4, docs/beam-racing.md): when the scan starts, which
//! slices go to the screen at which time, and what a slice that comes too late does. Pure
//! arithmetic and a state machine over plain values, so it is tested on synthetic traces; the
//! draws and the presents are in `stream/render.rs`.
//!
//! The model. A tearing present on an idle variable refresh display starts a new scan. The first
//! picture row is on the screen `delta` after the present was issued (the probe measures it), and
//! row `r` `r * row_ns` after that. A slice presented at `p` is on the screen about `call` later
//! (the present call), so it must be presented before the beam reaches its first row, with a
//! margin `m` for how much that varies. The scan starts as late as the slice that is tightest
//! against the beam needs, and as early as the first slice allows; it is raced only when that
//! start is at least `MIN_GAIN_US` ahead of presenting the whole picture on its final decode.
