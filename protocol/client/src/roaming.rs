//! Client roaming without sockets: the client's half of the path validation in
//! [`rubylight_protocol::roaming`] (`docs/protocol/client-roaming.md`).
//!
//! [`Roaming`] is driven by triggers ([`Roaming::start`]), the roaming datagrams the control
//! socket set aside ([`Roaming::handle_datagram`]) and its timer ([`Roaming::poll`]). It
//! queues datagrams for the host's control port ([`Roaming::poll_transmit`]) and reports
//! [`RoamEvent`]s ([`Roaming::take_events`]). The control driver runs it only when the host
//! advertised roaming and the client's setting is on.
//!
//! An attempt sends PROBE every 250 ms twelve times, then once a second; answers each
//! CHALLENGE that echoes its `nonce_c` with CONFIRM; and ends on a MIGRATED that names a
//! challenge it confirmed. Once it confirmed, it resends the CONFIRM for the newest challenge
//! every 250 ms instead of probing, so a round trip longer than the probe interval does not
//! keep asking the host for new challenges; after 3 s without a MIGRATED it probes again.
//! Without a MIGRATED it gives up after the drop tolerance (at most 10 s) and leaves the
//! stream to its usual paths: the control peer's timeout ends it, or bounded recovery
//! reconnects.
