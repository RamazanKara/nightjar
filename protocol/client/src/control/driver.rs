//! Runs a [`ControlSession`] and an [`InputQueue`] over ENet (rusty_enet, which the Rubylight
//! host also uses).
//!
//! [`connect`] opens the ENet peer with the control stream's 48 channels and the RTSP
//! connect data, and returns a [`ControlClient`] to run on a thread of the caller's choosing
//! and a [`ControlHandle`] for every other thread. The handle wakes the client through a
//! loopback datagram, so it sleeps on its socket between ENet timers.
//!
//! Teardown follows Nightjar's patched `stopControlStream`: queued input is drained, then the
//! peer disconnects gracefully and lingers up to two seconds for the host's acknowledgement,
//! unless the host already sent a disconnect or a termination message.
//!
//! When the host advertised roaming and [`DriverConfig::roaming`] is on, the driver also runs
//! [`Roaming`] beside ENet on the same socket: it sets roaming datagrams aside before ENet
//! sees them, and starts an attempt on [`ControlHandle::network_changed`] or after a second
//! without a word from the host.
