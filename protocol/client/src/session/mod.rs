//! The streaming session: the Rust counterpart of moonlight-common-c's LiStartConnection and
//! LiStopConnection. [`Session::start`] resolves the host, runs the RTSP handshake, connects
//! the control stream and starts the video, audio and input paths on their own threads;
//! [`Session::stop`] (or dropping the session) tears them down in the C's order.
//!
//! Ported from moonlight-common-c (GPL-3.0, Cameron Gutman and contributors):
//! `Connection.c`, the thread and socket parts of `VideoStream.c`, `AudioStream.c` and
//! `ControlStream.c`, with Nightjar's `android_connection.c` (input-only sessions, the
//! microphone with the last stage), its network grace and video receive buffer patches.
//!
//! Applications plug in a [`VideoDecoder`], an [`AudioRenderer`] and a [`Listener`]; the
//! session never decodes, renders or plays anything itself. It is platform-neutral: the
//! Android JNI bridge and the desktop clients use the same API.
