//! What every Nightjar app shows of file transfer, shared so that they all behave alike: the
//! transfer list (queued, running, done, failed, cancelled), the host's per-device limits that
//! decide which transfer starts next, what each refusal means for the user, the name an upload
//! is sent under, and a download that never leaves a short file behind.
//!
//! The host serves no ranges, so nothing resumes: retrying a failed or cancelled transfer sends
//! or fetches the whole file again. Progress comes from `upload_file` and `download_file`, which
//! move 64 KiB (upload) and 16 KiB (download) pieces and report at 0, at most every 256 KiB and
//! 100 ms, and at the end.
