//! The row order of the Rubylight host (`x-ss-video[0].pyrowaveRowOrder:1`): which picture band
//! each block record belongs to, and a tracker that says, as the records of a frame complete,
//! which bands can be decoded exactly.
//!
//! With the order on, the host sends the coarse level first and then the fine records by picture
//! band: block row `r` of wavelet level `L` is needed by picture band `k` (64 rows, one block row
//! of level 0) when `r * 2^L - 1 <= k`, because the inverse wavelet's four lifting steps of +-1
//! reach under one block row at every level. [`row_steps`] gives that band, the record's step,
//! for every block index; it matches the host's `row_steps` in `butterpollo-core`
//! (`rust/core/src/pyrowave.rs`) value for value, which `tests` pins with vectors taken from it.
//!
//! Every record with a step up to `k` having arrived is exactly what band `k` needs, so a decoder
//! that treats the missing blocks as zero reproduces the full decode on those rows.
