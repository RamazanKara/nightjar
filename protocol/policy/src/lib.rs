//! Nightjar's stream policies, shared by the desktop clients and, once the C engine is gone, the
//! Android app. Pure logic: no I/O and no clock. Callers pass time in as `now_ms` from a
//! monotonic clock.

//! Until Android calls this crate, the Java originals stay equal to it through the shared traces
//! in `tests/traces` (see [`trace`]).
